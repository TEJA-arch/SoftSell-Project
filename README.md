# SoftSell-Project
SoftSell is a platform that helps businesses monetize their idle software licenses. For example, if a company has extra Microsoft or Adobe licenses they're not using, they can come to this platform, submit those licenses, and get a quick market valuationâ€”then receive payment within 24 hours.
